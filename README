part-hotplug-handler is a lightweight, udev-based process which waits for
partition-related events and runs a handler process, which can be used for the
creation of UI elements (e.g a partitions menu), automatic mounting and more.

part-hotplug-handler can be used with any Linux (http://www.kernel.org/)
distribution with udev, although its primary goal is to replace the
pup_event_frontend_d script used by Puppy Linux (http://www.puppylinux.org/).
